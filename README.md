# Strategic IPP Cost Manipulation by Price Forecasting in Energy Markets Using ARIMA Model

Abstract: Electrical energy markets work on the principle of pooling, whereby multiple generators and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) offer their generation capacity along with its associated cost to the market. The market operator then clears the market based on a cost merit curve. In order to generate maximum profit, IPPs generally act strategically by manipulating the cost of offered energy. However, for this strategic behavior, IPPs have to forecast the market clearing outcomes before the market clears i.e. the resulting energy prices in the market and the associated energy they will be able to sell. Hence, this behavior would be as effective as the predicted energy price. Therefore, in this project, we try to predict future energy prices effectively and accurately, and note that this would have a direct consequence on the startegic behavior of IPPs in energy markets.

We leverage Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to predict future energy prices using historical data obtained from U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).
